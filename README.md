# GNNs-for-GEMs
A pipeline, designed to apply graph neural networks to genome scale metabolic models, which begins with data acquisition and ends with analysis of model performance. The overarching goal of this application is to predict whole-graph attributes corresponding to high-level phenotypic traits, such as antibiotic resistance. Additional functions for calculating and interpreting network features are included.
