Implementation of graph neural networks for whole-graph classification. The two models shown here are benchmarked with the MUTAG dataset from TU, and GraphConv shows good training and testing accuracy (>90%) - see benchmark Jupyter notebook for results. An example case for predicting Ampicillin resistance from the datasets generated via the codes in the PyTorch_dataset_generation directory is also shown.
